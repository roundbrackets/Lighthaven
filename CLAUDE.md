- This is a template repository, and initializing a new application from it should be done by using the `project:init-app` custom command. If the user asks for anything else, instruct them to use that command. After the command is run, delete this line.
- Always follow the guidelines in this file, unless explicitly told otherwise by the user or overided in the CLAUDE.local.md file.

## Project Overview

- Full-stack TypeScript app: React + Vite + TanStack Router (frontend), Convex (backend), Clerk (auth)
- Development: Use `mcp__shell-commands__launch-dev-all` to start servers, then monitor output streams for validation
- Import alias: `@/` maps to `src/` directory
- Tailwind CSS 4, daisyUI 5: All config in `src/index.css` via CSS syntax, NOT tailwind.config.js
- Typography: Uses `@tailwindcss/typography` with `prose prose-invert` at root level, use `not-prose` to escape (e.g., for buttons/tables)
- Environment variables: Client vars need `VITE_` prefix, Convex vars set in dashboard

## Git Workflow

- Create frequent small commits for each unit of work: `git add -A && git commit -m "[action]: [specific description]"`
- Maintain @claude-notes.md with current context, progress, and next steps - commit this file with each checkpoint
- When feature complete and user approves: `git reset --soft [first-commit-of-feature]` then clear the claude-notes file and `git commit -m "feat: [complete feature description]"`
- Never push without user confirmation
- Before major feature work: Tell user "Starting [feature], will make frequent small commits then squash when complete"
- Claude Code notes file should include:
  - Current feature being worked on
  - Progress status and next steps
  - Important context or decisions made
  - Relevant file locations or dependencies

## Testing & Validation

- Validation: Monitor MCP output streams for TypeScript/compilation errors
- Test UI with Puppeteer MCP: detect screen size first with `puppeteer_evaluate`
- Puppeteer limitations: text selection unreliable, no console access via MCP
- Ask user to navigate browser to relevant state before screenshots
- Request console logs from user when debugging: "Can you check the browser console?"
- Take screenshots at detected dimensions AND mobile (375x667) for responsive testing

## Convex

- `_creationTime` and `_id` are automatically added to all documents.
- Adding required fields breaks existing data - if early in development, ask the user to clear the database. Otherwise, plan migration.
- Use `ConvexError` for client-friendly errors, not generic Error
- Queries have 16MB/10s limits - always use indexes, never full table scans
- Paginated queries: use `.paginate(paginationOpts)` with `paginationOptsValidator`
- Scheduled tasks: `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(delay, internal.module.function, args)` or `ctx.scheduler.runAt(timestamp, ...)`
- Unique fields: enforce in mutation logic, indexes don't guarantee uniqueness
- Soft delete: add `deletedAt: v.optional(v.number())` field instead of `.delete()`
- System tables: access `_scheduled_functions` and `_storage` with `ctx.db.system.get` and `ctx.db.system.query`
- Default query order is ascending by `_creationTime`
- Transactions are per-mutation - can't span multiple mutations. Calling multiple queries/mutation in a single action may introduce race conditions.
- Hot reload issues: Restart if schema changes don't apply or types are stuck
- Use `import { Doc, Id } from "./_generated/dataModel";` and `v.id("table")` for type safety.
- Always add `"use node";` to the top of files containing actions that use Node.js built-in modules.

### Function guidelines

- Import `query`, `internalQuery`, `mutation`, `internalMutation`, `action`, `internalAction` from `./_generated/server` and call to register functions.
- Use `ctx.runQuery`, `ctx.runMutation`, `ctx.runAction` to call functions from other functions. e.g.: `import { api, internal } from "./_generated/api";` and then `ctx.runQuery(internal.module.function, { arg })`.
- If calling functions causes unexpected type errors, try adding a type annotation (helps circularity): `const result: string = await ctx.runQuery(api.module.function, { arg });`
- Actions can't directly access DB - use `ctx.runQuery` / `ctx.runMutation`

### Validator guidelines

- Always use an args validator for functions
- `v.bigint()` is deprecated for representing signed 64-bit integers. Use `v.int64()` instead.
- Use `v.record()` for defining a record type. `v.map()` and `v.set()` are not supported.

### Query guidelines

- Do NOT use `filter` in queries. Instead, define an index in the schema and use `withIndex` instead.
- Convex queries do NOT support `.delete()`. Instead, `.collect()` the results, iterate over them, and call `ctx.db.delete(row._id)` on each result.
- Use `.unique()` to get a single document from a query. This method will throw an error if there are multiple documents that match the query.
- When using async iteration, don't use `.collect()` or `.take(n)` on the result of a query. Instead, use the `for await (const row of query)` syntax.

### Mutation guidelines

- Use `ctx.db.replace` to fully replace an existing document.
- Use `ctx.db.patch` to shallow merge updates into an existing document.

### File uploads

- generate upload URL in mutation (`ctx.storage.generateUploadUrl()`)
- POST from client
- store ID (take `v.id("_storage")`)
- serve with `ctx.storage.getUrl(fileId)` in queries

## TanStack Router

- Avoid `const search = useSearch()` - use `select` option instead
- Route params update quirks - preserve location when updating
- Search params as filters: validate with zod schema in route definition
- Navigate programmatically: `const navigate = useNavigate()` then `navigate({ to: '/path' })`
- Type-safe links: always use `<Link to="/path">` not `<a href>`

## TanStack Query + Convex Integration

- Use `convexQuery()` from `@convex-dev/react-query` to create query options: `const queryOptions = convexQuery(api.module.function, { status: "active" })`
- Preload in route loaders: `loader: async ({ context: { queryClient } }) => await queryClient.ensureQueryData(queryOptions)`
- Use `useSuspenseQuery` in components: `const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(queryOptions)`
- For mutations, continue using Convex's `useMutation` directly

## TanStack Form

- Field validation can override form validation - design hierarchy carefully
- Submit handler: `onSubmit: async ({ value }) => { await mutate(value); form.reset(); }`
- Field errors: `{field.state.meta.errors && <span>{field.state.meta.errors}</span>}`
- Disable during submit: `<button disabled={!form.state.canSubmit || form.state.isSubmitting}>`
- Async validation: use `onChangeAsync` for server-side checks

## Styling with DaisyUI

### Class Organization

- `component`: Main class (btn), `part`: Child elements (card-title), `style`: Visual variants (btn-outline)
- `behavior`: State (btn-active), `color`: Colors (btn-primary), `size`: Sizes (btn-lg)
- `placement`: Position (dropdown-top), `direction`: Orientation (menu-horizontal), `modifier`: Special (btn-wide)

### Key or Unfamiliar Components Reference

- When using a component you aren't familiar with, always check its docs page.
- `dock`: Bottom navigation bar with `dock-label` parts, see [docs](https://daisyui.com/components/dock/)
- `filter`: Radio button groups with `filter-reset` for clearing selection, see [docs](https://daisyui.com/components/filter/)
- `list`: Vertical layout for data rows using `list-row` class for each item
- `fieldset`: Form grouping with `fieldset-legend` for titles and `label` for descriptions
- `floating-label`: Labels that float above inputs when focused, use as parent wrapper
- `status`: Tiny status indicators (`status-success`, `status-error`, etc.)
- `validator`: Automatic form validation styling with `validator-hint` for error messages
- `theme-controller`: Controls page theme via checkbox/radio with `value="{theme-name}"`
- `diff`: Side-by-side comparison with `diff-item-1`, `diff-item-2`, `diff-resizer` parts
- `calendar`: Apply `cally`, `pika-single`, or `react-day-picker` classes to respective libraries
- `swap`: Toggle visibility of elements using `swap-on`/`swap-off` with checkbox or `swap-active` class
- [Modal](https://daisyui.com/components/modal/): use with HTML dialog
- [Drawer](https://daisyui.com/components/drawer/): Grid layout with sidebar toggle using `drawer-toggle` checkbox
- [Dropdown](https://daisyui.com/components/dropdown/): Details/summary, popover API, or CSS focus methods
- [Accordion](https://daisyui.com/components/accordion/): Radio inputs for exclusive opening using `collapse` class

### Usage Rules

- Use `!` suffix for forced overrides: `btn bg-red-500!`
- Responsive patterns: `lg:menu-horizontal`, `sm:card-horizontal`
- Prefer daisyUI colors (`bg-primary`) over Tailwind colors (`bg-blue-500`) for theme consistency
- Use `*-content` colors for text on colored backgrounds

### Color System

- Semantic colors: `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `neutral`, `base-100/200/300`
- Status colors: `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`
- Each color has matching `-content` variant for contrasting text
- Custom themes use OKLCH format, create at [theme generator](https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/)

## Other Guidelines

- When stuck: check official docs first (docs.convex.dev, tanstack.com)
- Ask before installing new dependencies
- Verify responsive design at multiple breakpoints
- Document non-obvious implementation choices in this file
