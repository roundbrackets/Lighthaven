# Initialize New Application

Help a user initialize their new application using this template. Track progress using TodoWrite and @claude-notes.md throughout.

## Step 1: Project Discovery

- Create todos for the initialization process
- Start @claude-notes.md with current step (including instruction to reread this file if starting from a fresh session)
- Ask what they want to build
- Clarify key aspects: target users, main problem, core features
- Document responses and commit. Delete the first line of CLAUDE.md to remove the template instructions.

## Step 2: MVP Definition

- Help narrow to smallest viable MVP
- Focus on ONE core feature that delivers most value
- Get confirmation on MVP scope
- Update notes and commit

## Step 3: Implementation

- Plan required Convex tables, UI components, and interactions
- Remove demo content (user listing, placeholder text) but keep useful layout structure unless explicitly requested otherwise
- Implement the MVP:
  - Convex schema and functions
  - Main UI components
  - Core functionality
- Test the implementation
- Update notes and commit

## Step 4: Theme Customization

- Ask if they want custom colors
- If yes, guide them to https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/
- Have them create light and dark themes
- Integrate their themes into src/index.css
- Test both themes work correctly
- Update notes and commit

## Notes

- Adapt workflow based on user needs
- Note in @claude-notes.md which step to continue from in future sessions
